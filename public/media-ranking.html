<h1>Best Pieces of Media - Movies, Songs and Games - According to Myself</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>Collateral</h3>
            <p>I've watched this movie several times and it never ceases to amaze me.</p>
        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
            <p>I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but I think this one is one of, if no the best piece of media of this genre.</p>
        <h3>Schindler's List</h3>
            <p>I'm also a big fan of historical drama and/or war movies. This one is a masterpiece.</p>
    <h2>My Top 3 Songs</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>"The Red Carpet Day" by Versailles</h3>
            <p>A great song from a great band from Japan.</p>
        <h3>"When You Were Young" by The Killers</h3>
            <p>Few songs manage to invoke such strong feelings of nostalgia in me.</p>
        <h3>"Ao no Sumika - Where Our Blue Is" by Tatsuya Kitani </h3>
            <p>Same reason as above.</p>
    <h2>My Top 3 Games</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</h3>
            <p>An all time classic.</p>
        <h3>Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</h3>
            <p>Out of all Souls-Like games, this one definitely has a special place in my heart, probably for being the first one I've ever played.</p>
        <h3>Mega Man X4</h3>
            <p>I'm a big fan of old school games, especially sidescrollers and/or platformers. Out of all Mega Man games, X4 is the best one, in my personal opinion.</p>
